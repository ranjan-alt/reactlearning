for starting the project configure webpack and babel 

Babel
We mentioned at the beginning of the chapter that all the code in the book would be
using ES6 JavaScript. However, most browsers in use today do not fully support ES6.
Babel is a JavaScript transpiler. Babel turns ES6 code into ES5 code. We call this
process transpiling. So we can enjoy the features of ES6 today yet ensure our code
still runs in browsers that only support ES5.
